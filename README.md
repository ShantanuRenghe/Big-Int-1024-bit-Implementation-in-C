# Large Number Arithmetic in C

## Overview
This C program provides arithmetic operations for large numbers represented as strings. It supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of large integers, overcoming the limitations of standard data types in C.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations:**
  - Addition: Perform addition of two large numbers.
  - Subtraction: Compute the difference between two large numbers.
  - Multiplication: Multiply two large numbers efficiently.

- **Input Parsing:**
  - Parse strings representing large numbers into internal data structures.
  - Handle positive and negative numbers seamlessly.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Prompt users for input through the command line interface.
  - Guide users through specifying operations and entering numbers.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Detect and handle invalid input gracefully.
  - Ensure proper memory management to prevent memory leaks.

## Getting Started
1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the program using a C compiler such as gcc.
     ```bash
     gcc BIA.c -o BIA
2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled executable
     ```bash
     .\BIA
3. **Usage:**
    - Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations.

## Usage:
- Enter two large numbers along with the desired arithmetic operation.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the operation and view the result.

## Notes
- Ensure that the input numbers do not exceed the defined maximum digits.
- Ensure that the C compiler is installed on your system.
